connect mongo

0> getURL and username password
1. npm install mongoose
2. if you created a password with special characters, then you'll need to URL encode that password (optional in certain condition [: / ? # [ ] @ ! $ & ' ( ) * , ; = % ]) {https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/troubleshoot-connection/#special-characters-in-connection-string-password}
e.g. >> p@ssw0rd'9'!
is >> p%40ssw0rd%279%27%21


3. run your app like >> node mongo.js yourPassword
and when running app in dev >> npm run dev yourPassword [backend]


#Schema

the object will save like this 
{
  _id: new ObjectId('661f5e344acb41c60cc8a085'),
  content: 'HTML is easy',
  important: true,
  __v: 0
}

4. We also don't want to return the mongo versioning field __v to the frontend and also  _id property of Mongoose objects looks like a string, it is in fact an object.
One way to format the objects returned by Mongoose is to modify {https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7034848/mongodb-output-id-instead-of-id} the toJSON method of the schema, which is used on all instances of the models produced with that schema.

The toJSON method we defined transforms it into a string

noteSchema.set('toJSON', {
  transform: (document, returnedObject) => {
    returnedObject.id = returnedObject._id.toString()
    delete returnedObject._id
    delete returnedObject.__v
  }
})


5. Moving db configuration to its own module e.g. models/note.js

const url = process.env.MONGODB_URI
// not hardcoded ==instead the address of the database is passed to the application via the MONGODB_URI environment variable.

many way to use MONGODB_URI
a. MONGODB_URI=address_here npm run dev
b. dotenv library {recommended} >> npm install dotenv

... To use the library, we create a .env file at the root of the project.
... .env file should be gitignored right away
..inside paste 
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://fullstack:thepasswordishere@cluster0.o1opl.mongodb.net/noteApp?retryWrites=true&w=majority
PORT=3001

...reference them in your code just like you would reference normal environment variables, with the process.env.MONGODB_URI syntax.
